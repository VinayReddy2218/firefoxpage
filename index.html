    <p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/">Mozilla Firefox</a>, or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source[24] web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.[25] In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.[26] Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD,[9] OpenBSD,[10] NetBSD,[11] illumos,[12] and Solaris Unix.[14] Firefox is also available for Android and iOS; however, the iOS version uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due to platform limitations, as with all other iOS web browsers. </p>
